# HTML Elements

---

A lightweight typescript/javascript  library to improve read and write of code
generated HTML strings. Each HTML element is a `Element` class that can be
changed after creation and have the HTML re-generated again by calling `toHTML`
function.
Another option is provided to use only functions instead of classes. It is a
better option to build faster HTML code without calling the `toHTML` function if
dynamic code is not needed.

#### Examples
```
import classes from ''
```
